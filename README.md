# multiple_linear_regression_from scratch
I recently created a jupyter notebook project that contains an implementation of multiple linear regression through custom functions implemented in python numpy. It's a great way to understand how regression works in the back end and what exactly z normalization is, along with how gradient descent, the cost function, and calculation of derivatives works.
